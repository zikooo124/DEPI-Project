# Disease Risk Assessment

This project leverages historical public health data to identify patterns in disease incidence, forecast future outbreaks, and model healthcare resource utilization. By integrating data engineering, predictive modeling, and interactive visualization, we aim to provide actionable insights for proactive public health interventions and efficient resource allocation.

## Project Objectives

* 
**Trend Analysis**: Identify patterns in disease incidence and historical public health trends.


* 
**Outbreak Forecasting**: Predict future case counts and identify high-risk periods for hospital overload.


* 
**Resource Optimization**: Model hospital admissions, ICU bed occupancy, and vaccine inventory needs.


* 
**Strategic Insights**: Provide data-driven recommendations for targeted public health responses and outbreak containment.



---

## Dataset Overview

The analysis utilizes a comprehensive synthetic/public dataset containing:

* 
**Time Series Data**: Weekly and monthly disease case counts by region.


* 
**Demographic Data**: Population statistics categorized by age group and region, alongside vaccination rates.


* 
**Resource Data**: Real-time metrics on hospital admissions, ICU bed occupancy, and vaccine stock.


* 
**Metadata**: Regional identifiers, dates, and specific disease codes.

## Methodology & Roadmap

### Phase 1: Data Engineering (Week 1)

* 
**Star Schema Design**: Architecting a data model focused on health events, regions, and diseases.


* 
**Preprocessing**: Standardizing region names, handling missing values, and calculating incidence rates per 100k population.


* 
**Tools**: SQL for data modeling and Python for cleaning.



### Phase 2: Exploratory Analysis (Week 2)

* 
**Correlation Studies**: Analyzing the relationship between vaccination rates and subsequent case counts.


* 
**Demographic Impact**: Determining how population density and age groups correlate with incidence rates.


* 
**Resource Impact**: Evaluating fluctuations in hospital utilization during active outbreaks.



### Phase 3: Predictive Modeling & Forecasting (Week 3)

* 
**Time-Series Forecasting**: Utilizing **SARIMA** or **Prophet** to predict case counts for the next 3-6 months.


* 
**Scenario Analysis**: Modeling the impact of a 10% increase in vaccination coverage on future caseloads.


* 
**Evaluation**: Measuring model performance using MAE and RMSE metrics.



### Phase 4: Visualization & Delivery (Week 4)

* 
**Tableau Dashboard**: Building an interactive dashboard featuring national hotspot alerts and executive summaries.


* 
**Deep Dives**: Implementing filters for demographics and 6-month forecasts with confidence intervals.


* 
**Resource Linking**: Directly connecting case forecasts to simulated hospital resource requirements.



---

## Expected Outcomes

* 
**Proactive Response**: Facilitating faster, more targeted containment of public health outbreaks.


* 
**End-to-End Pipeline**: A fully demonstrable project showcasing skills in data engineering, predictive analytics, and data visualization.
